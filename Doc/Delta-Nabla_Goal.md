# Low cost

## By Delta-Nabla

By low cost we understand the use of more cost efficient equipment, machines and robots in our solution for the 2 sorting and packaging lines.

We can achieve this goal by doing the following:

- Eliminate redundant machines by using multi purpose machines, or have one machine do multiple similar machines processes
- Parts are design after a standardized sizing and modularity
- Optimize Material usage in the process
