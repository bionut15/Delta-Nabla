  - low-cost: price
  - safe: incidents/year, comply to safety standards and good practices
  - as productive as necessary: fulfills the required production volume
  - good quality: No. good parts/No. scrap parts

- Production department:

  - low-cost: price
  - highly automated: No. of operators
  - highly productive: No. of pieces/min

- Maintenance department:

  - easy to maintain: Easy to reach parts, Easy to check the machine, Simple to replace parts, No. of failures
  - easy to debug: Traceability, Detailed dashboard, Logs and reports, clear error messages
  - self-checks: The machine should have self-checks
  - simple to assemble and move around

- Operators:
