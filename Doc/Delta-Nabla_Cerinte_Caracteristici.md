# What are the requierments for the design and construction of the line?

# Which are the key characteristics of the robotic production line that quantify the degree to which it fufills the requierments?

# The Stakeholders

- Management of the client factory:

  - low-cost: price
  - safe: incidents/year, comply to safety standards and good practices
  - as productive as necessary: fufills the requiered production volume
  - good quality: No. good parts/No. scrap parts

- Production department:

  - low-cost: price
  - highly automated: No. of operators
  - highly productive: No. of pieces/min

- Maintainance department:

  - easy to maintain: Easy to reach parts, Easy to check the machine, Simple to replace parts, No. of failures
  - easy to debug: Traceability, Detailed dashboard, Logs and reports, clear error messages
  - selfchecks: The machine should have selfchecks
  - simple to assemble and move around

- Operators:

  - easy to use: easy to undestand, clear error reporting and messages, intuitive UI
  - Idiotproof: Make the correct usage as easy as possible and make incorrect usage difficult or impossible
  - safe: as safe as possible
